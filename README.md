# Budget Analyzer

This program is a personal script to show yearly totals as well as itemized expenses for csv
exported data from the [Budget](https://intuitive.studio/budget/) iOS app.

Hard coded values are at the top of the `main.rs` value for the file location and category name.
Should this project ever warrant flexibility, command line arguments can be added.
